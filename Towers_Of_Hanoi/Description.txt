/* Towers of Hanoi
 *
 * The Towers of Hanoi puzzle has n disks of different sizes that can slide onto any of three pegs.  
 * Initially, all the disks are on the first peg in order of size, the largest on the bottom and the smallest on top.  
 * The goal is to move all the disks to the third peg, using the second one as an auxiliary, if necessary. 
 * We can move only one disk at a time, and it is forbidden to place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. 
 * 
 * This program solves the Towers of Hanoi problem using recursion. (No hard-coding!) 
 * The user must be able to specify the number of starting disks (1 < n < 8). 
 * At the start and each time a disk is moved, you should output the state of the entire domain so it is clear which
 * disk was moved and to where.  I represent each disk with an integer (smaller numbers indicate smaller disks).
